            <p>Our mission is to create a helpful and simple solution for finding misplaced items. It is our
                top priority to create a safe and effective environment. For this reason, it is very important
                that we outline rules of conduct and community guidelines for how the site should be used. We believe
                that these guidelines allow the site to be used in a manner consistent with the creators' visions. 
                As we partner with campuses to tailor the product to their specific needs, violations to these guidelines 
                are brought through the path designated and users could be banned from the platform.

                    <b>Don't steal.</b> Finders aren't keepers! That means if you're retreiving lost items from a drop off location, 
                        you might be asked a couple of questions about the item to ensure it's yours.

                    <b>Don't hate.</b> Our platform has a pretty specific purpose, but any platform with user-to-user interaction 
                    has the potential to be said. Generally speaking, any usage of Lost Then Found to communicate or share personal
                    information isn't allowed, but we define hate speech as content that does or intends to attack, threaten, incite 
                    violence against, or dehumanize an individual or a group of individuals on the basis of protected attributes. 
                    We also do not allow content that verbally or physically threatens violence or depicts harm to an individual or a 
                    group based on any of the following protected attributes:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Race </li>
