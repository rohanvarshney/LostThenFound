            <h1><b>Lost Then Found</b> is a digital, community-based lost-and-found solution for college campuses.</h1>
            <p>Misplacing items on campus is a common nuisance for busy college students and faculty. 
                It can cost lots of valuable time and money to search for and replace important items, 
                and most universities have no effective systems in place to make the searching process easier and more 
                efficient. To solve this issue, we are introducing Lost Then Found: a consolidated lost and found solution 
                that allows people to quickly and easily find items they have lost and return items they have found. 
                This one-stop, campus-wide solution offers an easily-accessible website with two-way posting and an 
                automatic post matching algorithm to connect people who have lost their items to those who have found them. 
                It gives students a much higher likelihood of finding their item without ever having to physically search for 
                it at all, and minimizes the time commitment and stress expenditure in the lost and found process. </p>
                <h1>The Dream Team</h1>
                <p>Our team consists of five innovative and hardworking Computer Science students at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
                    We know first-hand the struggles of misplacing items on campus, and we have put plenty of hard work and 
                    creativity into crafting this elegant solution.</p>
